A.N.T. RADIO, THE ARCHIVE OF NOISE TRANSMISSION, WOULD LIKE TO CORDIALLY INVITE YOU TO BROADCAST! WE ARE LOOKING FOR ARTISTS, MUSICIANS, WRITERS, DJS, EDUCATORS, AND WEIRDOS TO APPLY FOR BROADCASTING SLOTS THIS SUMMER. PITCH US WHATEVER YOU GOT USING THE QR CODE THAT LINKS YOU TO OUR APPLICATION FORM, NO PRIOR EXPERIENCE IS NECESSARY. INSPIRED BY THE FREE RADIO MOVEMENT AND THE RESURGENCE OF PIRATE RADIO OPERATORS RECLAIMING SONIC SPACE AS COMMUNAL RESOURCES, WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A COMMUNITY RADIO STATION. OUR AIM IS TO OFFER A DIGITAL SPHERE WHEREIN LOCAL COMMUNITY MEMBERS CAN ARTICULATE THEIR IDEAS FREELY. OUR PROGRAMMING IS COLLABORATIVELY PRODUCED, PROVIDING A PLATFORM FOR EMERGING ARTISTS AND ACTIVISTS – LIKE YOU
